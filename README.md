# Jammming

Jammming is a simple React app built with the guidance of Codecademy's "Full-Stack Engineer" career path. The purpose of the exercise is to create a simple app that allows the user to

-   connect their Spotify account to the app
-   search for songs
-   add selected songs to a new playlist
-   name the playlist and save it to their Spotify account

The things that I learned and practiced during the creation of this app were:

-   how to create stateful and stateless components
-   how to pass props from one component to another
-   how to pass a state as a prop to a component
-   how to use Fetch API to make GET and POST requests
-   how to handle promises and data that they might return
